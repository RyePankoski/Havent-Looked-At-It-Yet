How to set up Docker, for windows and linux. 


Windows:


1. Download the application (docker Desktop) from the Docker website. 
2. After you have downloaded the application, navigate to the folder where you are housing your image data. 
   1. An image is like a lightweight version of an operating system that contains all the libraries, dependencies, and functionality to run an app within docker. 
3. Start a terminal inside the directory where your image files are held.
   1. By terminal, we mean Powershell.
   2. docker build -t your-image-name .
4. In some cases you can just use the interface in the application to start your docker container. 
   1. Otherwise, use this command - docker run -d --name my-container -p 5000:5000 my-web-app
   2. Remember to replace -name, my-container with your own names.
Linux:
1. For linux, the process is slightly different but it involved building directories for Docker within the terminal. The Docker website has a very thorough tutorial on setting it up for Linux. 
   1. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
2. If you are running on Ubuntu 24.04, you will need to run the following terminal commands 
   1. sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
   2. sudo systemctl --user restart docker-desktop
3. After the applications running, use the commands in the terminal, within the directory of the image:
   1. docker build -t your-image-name .
   2. docker run -d --name my-container -p 5000:5000 my-web-app
